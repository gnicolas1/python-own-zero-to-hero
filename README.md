# python-own-zero-to-hero

Goal of this project is to learn Python following the zero to hero challenge.

Project rules (more or less) come from here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYE0QQKJI9o

* 5 simple projects with less than 200 lines of code. No frameworks are allowed. Up to 5 items.

* 3 medium projects with less than 500 lines of code. Frameworks can be used. Up to 10 items.

* 1 major project with more than 500 lines of code. Frameworks can be used. More than 10 items.

By items I mean some actions that the program can do, for example, add something to a list, delete something from the list, etc.
